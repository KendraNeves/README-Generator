# 09-README-Generator

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a node.js app that generates a README from the command line. This app is meant to simplify the process of creating a good README without sacrificing a high-quality and professional appearance. 


## Insights
In this project, I used the axios library to make an API call to github's API from node.js. I optimized this call by using async await and promises with axios to retrieve user metadata and populate the READMEI also became comfortable with using npm and installed the inquirer node module to facilitate asking the user questions that will appear on the newly created README.
